# GPS Based Airspeed Calculator

A paper on GPS based Airspeed calculator with improved accuracy. It also contains the conceptualised and tested C code based on simulated flight data. 

The paper was sent to the University of Purdue for review and we could not proceed further to test and implement the concept based on actual flight data due to our other commitments. However, the theory has been validated based on simulated flight data. 

An executable C program has been provided along with the paper. Hope it inspires the next generation of aeronautic and computer engineers to find a better solution to the traditional Pitot Tube based velocity calculator currently used in most aircrafts. Cheers.
